USB Missile Launcher control with python and scratch

This project was created by Pete Dring as a resource for teachers and students in schools.

It provides an interface in python that allows you to control a usb missile launcher in your own python projects or your
own scratch games / quizes.

It comes with an example scratch project that is an interactive quiz which teaches students what NOT, AND and OR logic gates do

There are 6 levels to the quiz. The first three teach how the logic gates behave and the last three test how much you've understood.
Be warned - if you get the answers wrong you'll get shot by the missile launcher!
